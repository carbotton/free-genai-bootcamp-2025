        Hallo! Let's get started with your German lesson.
        First, let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll work with vocabulary and sentence structure.
        Here's the vocabulary table:
        | German |	| English |
        | Bären	| bears |
        | sind	| are (you'll learn more about verb conjugation later) |
        | an	| at |
        | der  Tür	| the door (nominative case not used here, but genitive/dative) |
        | hast | have (part of the verb "haben" for "you") |
        | du |	you |
        | den Müll |	the garbage |
        | draußen	| out |
        | gelassen	| left (past participle of "lassen") |
        Possible sentence structure:
        Sentence = Subject + Verb + Prepositional Phrase + Question about action
        Your turn! Try to transcribe the sentence into German using the vocabulary above. I'll give you clues if you get stuck.
        How would you like to start?

        Sentence structure:
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists
        - The second part is asking about a past action

        Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
