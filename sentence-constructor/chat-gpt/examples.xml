        Hallo! Let's get started with your German lesson.
        First, let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll work with vocabulary and sentence structure.
        Here's the vocabulary table:
        | German |	| English |
        | Bären	| bears |
        | sind	| are (you'll learn more about verb conjugation later) |
        | an	| at |
        | der  Tür	| the door (nominative case not used here, but genitive/dative) |
        | hast | have (part of the verb "haben" for "you") |
        | du |	you |
        | den Müll |	the garbage |
        | draußen	| out |
        | gelassen	| left (past participle of "lassen") |
        Possible sentence structure:
        Sentence = Subject + Verb + Prepositional Phrase + Question about action
        Your turn! Try to transcribe the sentence into German using the vocabulary above. I'll give you clues if you get stuck.
        How would you like to start?

        - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediatly 
        - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre 
        - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations

        Sentence structure:
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists
        - The second part is asking about a past action

        Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
